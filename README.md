Predicting Emotions of People with Application of Machine Learning Algorithms on EEG Data
=========

**Table of Contents**

* Selection of the accuracy as the performance metrics.
* Application of data cleaning on 2132x2549 dimensional data set to improve the accuracy and the rate of convergence of the model.
* Detecting and removing unnecessary features.
* Obtaining a model that predicts if a person has positive, negative or neutral feelings 99.62% accurately in the test set.
